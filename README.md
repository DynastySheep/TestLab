# TestLab

This is a skillset project that aims to showcase my skills in C#, it will be a game project that might evolve into a full product if everything goes well. 
For now let it be a go-to for people who are interested to see the way I structure my code, which I aim to be at a good level.. together with naming convention being rational.
